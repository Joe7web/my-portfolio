Horiseon is digital marking company that needed to refactor its existing code for their main website. The goal was to upgrade their website's accessibility and search engine optimization. Another goal was to clean up the existing code and apply a more appropriate HTML semantic structure for easier readability and customization in the future.

As a forward-looking company, Horiseon was aware that it had to upgrade it user accessibility. Also, with being a company that offered SEO service to clients - they needed to make sure their SEO was where it needed to be.

The accessibility was solved by adding "alt" attributes to all images on the landing page.  We were able to increase their SEO by adding a title to the head.  Finally, by removing all div elements in the index.html page and applying a semantic structure to the HTML we were able to provide better readability and ease the customization for future programming on their website.
